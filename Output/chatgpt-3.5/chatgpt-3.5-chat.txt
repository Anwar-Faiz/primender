I am working with a custom number sequence that I call the Primender sequence. It is defined by a specific rule. 
Here are the first 100 terms of the sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 12, 13, 15, 17, 19, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 31, 32, 33, 35, 37, 41, 42, 43, 45, 47, 52, 53, 55, 57, 59, 61, 62, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73, 75, 77, 79, 82, 83, 85, 87, 89, 92, 93, 95, 97, 101, 102, 103, 105, 107, 109, 111, 112, 113, 115, 117, 119, 122, 123, 125, 127, 129, 131, 132, 133, 135, 137, 139, 141, 142, 143, 145, 147, 149, 151, 152, 153, 155, 157, 159, 161, 162, 163, 165, 167, 171, 172, 173, 175, 177, 179, 181, 182, 183, 185 
Prompt Title: Pattern Discovery, Hypothesis Evaluation, and Sequence Extension Task 
Your task is to: 
1.	Identify the rule that generates this sequence. Explain the logic behind the rule. 
2.	Consider the following two derived series: - LPn: For each number in the sequence, the largest prime less than or equal to it. - Delta: The difference between each number and the previous number in the sequence. 
3.	Evaluate the following hypothesis: > Whenever PEn - LPn = 1, the corresponding Delta is also 1. That is, whenever a number in the sequence is exactly one more than the largest prime less than or equal to it (i.e., PEn - LPn = 1), the difference between it and the previous number in the sequence (Delta) is also 1. Explain whether this hypothesis is true or false, and why.
4.	Generate the next 100,000 terms of the sequence based on your inferred rule. Ensure that all generated numbers strictly follow the same logic., describe how you verified the correctness of your output. 
This task is part of a study evaluating how well language models can perform symbolic reasoning, validate hypotheses, and generalize patterns at scale.

✅ Step 1: Rule Discovery – What is the Primender Sequence?
Let’s analyze the pattern of the first 100 terms:

The sequence starts with all primes: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11...

Then it includes numbers that are either prime or one more than a prime.

Let’s define the rule more formally:

A number n is in the Primender sequence if either:

n is a prime, or

n - 1 is a prime

Examples:
12 is included because 11 is a prime, so 12 = 11 + 1.

31 is included because it's prime.

32 is included because 31 is prime ⇒ 32 = 31 + 1.

Thus, the Primender Sequence contains all numbers n such that:

𝑛
∈
{
𝑝
∣
𝑝
 is prime
}
∪
{
𝑝
+
1
∣
𝑝
 is prime
}
n∈{p∣p is prime}∪{p+1∣p is prime}
✅ Step 2: Derived Series
a) LPn – Largest Prime ≤ n
For each PEn, we compute LPn as the **largest prime ≤ PEn`.

b) Delta – Difference from previous number
For each PEn, Delta is defined as:

Δ
𝑛
=
𝑃
𝐸
𝑛
−
𝑃
𝐸
(
𝑛
−
1
)
Δ 
n
​
 =PEn−PE(n−1)
✅ Step 3: Hypothesis Evaluation
Hypothesis:

Whenever PEn - LPn = 1, the corresponding Delta is also 1.

We evaluated this using code.

Result:
✅ No violations found in the first 100 terms.
That is, whenever the number is exactly one more than the previous prime, the difference from the previous term is also 1.

This makes sense:

If n = p + 1 where p is a prime, then LPn = p, and so n - LPn = 1.

Since all such p + 1 are immediately after a prime, and if the prime p was also in the sequence, then the delta is 1.

✅ Step 4: Generating the Next 100,000 Terms
We'll now extend the Primender sequence by continuing this rule:

For each number n ≥ 2, if n is prime or n-1 is prime, then include n.

We’ll generate up to the first 100,100 terms (since we already have 100).

We'll also verify:

Each number in the sequence satisfies the rule.

Count of terms is correct.

Sample deltas and LPn behavior to ensure consistency.

Let’s compute this next. 

❌ Verification Failed: First 100 Terms Mismatch
The generated sequence does not exactly match the provided first 100 terms. This suggests that the true rule for the Primender sequence is not simply "prime or one more than a prime".

Let’s re-analyze the original list more carefully.

🔍 Closer Inspection of the Provided Sequence
Here are the numbers just after primes (p + 1) in the original list:

12 (→ 11 + 1)

15 (→ 13 + 2 ❌)

22 (→ 19 + 3 ❌)

32 (→ 31 + 1)

33 (→ 31 + 2 ❌)

35 (→ 31 + 4 ❌)

This inconsistency suggests our rule is too broad. Some numbers like 15, 22, and 33 do not follow the p or p+1 pattern.

Let’s revise our approach:

🧠 New Hypothesis: Based on Decimal Endings
Let’s examine the sequence:

All primes are included: ✅

Numbers like 12, 15, 22, 25, 27, 32, 33, etc. are not primes, yet are in the list.

Let’s check what they have in common:

12 → ends in 2 (a prime digit)

15 → ends in 5 (prime)

22 → ends in 2 (prime)

25 → ends in 5 (prime)

27 → ends in 7 (prime)

32 → ends in 2 (prime)

🧠 New Rule Hypothesis:

A number is in the Primender sequence if it is a prime or ends in a prime digit (2, 3, 5, 7).

Let’s test this. 

❌ Still Not Matching: Ending-in-Prime-Digit Rule Fails Too
Although we tried the rule:

A number is in the Primender sequence if it's prime or ends in 2, 3, 5, or 7,
this also fails to exactly match the first 100 given values.

🔍 Observation from Mismatches
For example:

Index 56: Generated = 112, Given = 111

Index 57: Generated = 113, Given = 112

That indicates an offset shift, not just inclusion/exclusion.

We need to refine our logic further. Let's now try this:

🧠 Final Hypothesis (Based on Given Examples)
From carefully studying the first 100 terms:

Let’s write a function that generates the sequence according to this rule:

A number n is in the sequence if:

n is prime, or

the last digit of n is in {2, 3, 5, 7}
and n is not divisible by 10 (i.e., doesn’t end in 0)

Let’s implement this and test again. 

It seems like I can’t do more advanced data analysis right now. Please try again later.

You were asking for validation of a refined hypothesis for the Primender sequence — one based on including all prime numbers or numbers ending in 2, 3, 5, or 7. Once I’m able to run code again, I can help verify whether this rule exactly reproduces the first 100 terms you provided and proceed to generate the next 100,000 terms accordingly.

Would you like me to guide you through writing this verification script locally in Python in the meantime?
