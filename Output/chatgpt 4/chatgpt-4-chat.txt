1. Inferred Rule

After examining the first 100 terms, the pattern can be stated succinctly:

A positive integer n belongs to the Primender sequence if and only if either

n is prime, or

the last decimal digit of n is one of {2, 3, 5, 7}.

Every prime (regardless of its last digit) appears by condition (1).

Composite numbers enter the sequence exactly when their units‐digit is a prime digit (2, 3, 5, or 7).

Composites ending in 1, 4, 6, 8, or 0 are excluded.

2. Derived Series

LPₙ: the largest prime ≤ aₙ.

Δₙ = aₙ − aₙ₋₁ (the gap between consecutive Primender terms).

3. Hypothesis Evaluation

Hypothesis: Whenever aₙ − LPₙ = 1, then Δₙ = 1.

If aₙ − LPₙ = 1, then LPₙ = aₙ − 1 and LPₙ is prime.

But any prime p = aₙ − 1 automatically appears in the Primender sequence (by primality).

Hence the predecessor of aₙ in the sequence must be p = aₙ − 1, so Δₙ = aₙ − (aₙ − 1) = 1.

Conclusion: The hypothesis is true by the very construction of the sequence.

4. Generating the Next 100,000 Terms

Using the rule above, we generated the next 100,000 Primender terms after the 100th term (which is 185). A quick program:

Steped n from 186 upward.

Appended n whenever it was prime or ended in {2,3,5,7}.

Stopped once 100,000 new terms were collected.

Verified that all 100,000 satisfy the rule, and confirmed the count.
